# SurviVR

This repo is here for some practice in VR and procedural generation of worlds. Idealy we would like to create a survival game in VR for the cardboard (and in future iterations the oculus or vive).
This initially came from the repo: https://github.com/thadeaus/ProceduralGeneration however that was more of a sandbox and this is going to be more of an actual game

# Building and Playing

## For phone
* Set up your phone with developer mode and USB debugging enabled
* Attach phone to computer and click
	* File -> Build & Run
	* Build For android
	* Make sure the main scene (or scene you want to test) is selected
	* Click build and run
	* tap screen to move, turn head to change directions

## For Computer
* Open the scene you want
* Click the play button
* Click to move
* Hold ALT + Move mouse to look in the direction you want
* You can always switch to scene mode while playing to view the scene and move using regular unity controls

# Contributing

* Please feel free to make PRs as needed. You will need to get unity from https://unity3d.com/
* When creating something for a scene, please create a new scene to test it out and add instructions on how to add it to the main game.

## Systems we would like to have implemented:
(in no particular order)

* Better world generation (more interesting)
* Crafting system
* Resource systems (health, hunger, energy etc)
* Inventory system
* AI's (enemies or friendlies to give the world a more lively feeling)
* Eventually multiplayer would be great...
